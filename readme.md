# Shadow 3.0

Shadow is one of the greatest **free** scripting utilities for Roblox.

## Installation

Download the official build of Shadow from the [Shadow Cheats](https://www.shadowcheats.com/cheats) website. You can also download Shadow from [WeAreDevs](https://wearedevs.net/d/Shadow), however any other websites could potentially serve malware instead of the official Shadow build.

## Usage

You must have the latest version of [Roblox](http://www.roblox.com/Install/Setup.ashx) installed on your system. Afterwards, you can join any game and press "Attach" on Shadow. It may ask you to enter a key, you can access the key directly through typing "getkey" in the console popup. :ok_hand:

## Features

We've implemented various awesome features in Shadow 3.0, including but not limited to those listed below. You can find a ton of more listed features in any of the Shadow Update Logs in our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/J6kAFka9Jd).

- [x] Bit, Bistream, Cache, Crypt, Console, Debug, Drawing and Websocket Libraries.

There may be more features added to the list of features over time, this is not a finalized project and plans to be continued for many years to go in the future.

## Plans

We've implemented some great features throughout updates on Shadow, however there are still some improvements to be made. This is why we have decided to add a task log that shows our plans and once those plans have been deployed.

- [ ] Shadow Library, a library uses for miscellaneous functions already documented and Shadow-specific identifiers.
- [ ] Improving the Drawing Library, adding support for Images and other features for future script support.
- [ ] Better security in the module and interface to keep users data protected even further.

We could add more to the list above, those are all of our plans for future updates. You should be seeing these coming in future updates, so be prepared for these flawless plans in the task log.
