# Shadow 3.0

Shadow is the greatest **free** scripting utility for Roblox.

## Installation

Download the official build of Shadow from the [Shadow Cheats](https://www.shadowcheats.com/cheats) website. You can also download Shadow from [WeAreDevs](https://wearedevs.net/d/Shadow), however any other websites could potentially serve malware instead of the official Shadow build.

## Usage

You must have the latest version of [Roblox](http://www.roblox.com/Install/Setup.ashx) installed on your system. Afterwards, you can join any game and press "Attach" on Shadow. It may ask you to enter a key, you can access the key directly through typing "getkey" in the console popup. :ok_hand:

## Plans

We've implemented some great features throughout updates on Shadow, however there are still some improvements to be made. This is why we have decided to add a task log that shows our plans and once those plans have been deployed.

- [x] Bit, Console, Debug, Drawing, Mouse and Cryptography Libraries.
- [x] Uncommon functions such as "setfflag", "sethiddenproperty", "gethiddenproperty" and "getconnections" are implemented.
- [x] Internal interface for those playing in games where an internal interface is more convenient.
- [x] Re-attaching automatically whenever teleporting to a new place.
- [ ] Reaching out to script developers for Shadow 3.0 support on their paid scripts.

We could add more to the list above, those are all of our plans for future updates. You should be seeing these coming in future updates, so be prepared for these flawless plans in the task log.
